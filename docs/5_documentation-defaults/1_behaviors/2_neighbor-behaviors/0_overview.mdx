# Overview

Each neighbor behavior is implemented using the following types:

- [`INeighborBehaviorJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/) - Implementations schedules implementations of `INeighborBehaviorJob<C1, C2, A, R>`.
- [`INeighborBehaviorJob<C1, C2, A, R>`](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/#implementing-ineighborbehaviorjobc1-c2-a-r) - Implementations contain logic of the behavior.
    - `C1` - Component which should be on the main entities.
    - `C2` - Component which should be on the neighbor entities.
    - `R` - Results which the behavior uses.
- [`INeighborBaseBehavior`](/docs/documentation-core/components/INeighborBaseBehavior) - Implementations are [components](/docs/documentation-core/components/intro) used by the behavior.
- [`VelocityResult(s)`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult) - All behaviors use this type as their output.
