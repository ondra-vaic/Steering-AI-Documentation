# MultiHoming

Makes entities go towards the smallest of home areas they are currently in.

## MultiHomingJob

For this behavior, the neighbors need to have a `HomeComponent` on them. The component contains the radius and other properties of the home area. The behavior finds a home with the smallest radius which contains the entity. It gives a direction towards the target home. The behavior's strength grows as the distance to the home increases.

This behavior outputs the following: 
- `DesiredDirection` - Direction to the target home.
- `DirectionDesire` - From `0` to `DirectionStrength * home.StrengthMultiplier` as distance to the home goes from `home.MinRadius` to `home.MaxRadius`.
- `DesiredSpeed` - `0` *(constant)*
- `SpeedDesire` - `0` *(constant)*
- `Priority` -  `Priority` *(constant)*

## MultiHomingComponent

- *Activation*
    - `ActivationP` - Power for shaping the interpolation of `DirectionDesire`.
- `BaseData`
    - `MaxDistance` - Maximum distance where neighbors will be detected.
    - `MaxAngle` - Maximum field of view angle where neighbors will be detected.
    - `DirectionStrength` - Multiplies `DirectionDesire`.
    - `Priority` - Priority.

## HomeComponent

The neighbors which should work as homes need to have `HomeComponent` on them. It has the following properties:

- `MinRadius` - *radius around the home's position where the entity will stop desiring to go towards it*
- `MaxRadius` - *the entity will react to this home when within this radius*
- `StrengthMultiplier` - *multiplier for the `DirectionDesire`, this way some homes can have more influence than others*
