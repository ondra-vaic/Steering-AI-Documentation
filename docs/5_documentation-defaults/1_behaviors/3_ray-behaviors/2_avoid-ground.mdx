# Avoid Ground

Makes the entities avoid ground.

## AvoidGroundJob

The behavior expects that the ray query cast rays downwards. It can work with multiple rays, but a single ray downward using the [`DownSingleCreateRaysJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/ray-queries/down-single-create-rays) should be sufficient. The behavior always gives direction straight up. The strength grows as the average hit distance of the rays decreases.

This behavior outputs the following: 
- `DesiredDirection` - `new float(0, 1, 0)` *(constant)*
- `DirectionDesire` - From `0` to `DirectionStrength` as average distance to hit goes from `MaxDistance` to `0`.
- `DesiredSpeed` - `0` *(constant)*
- `SpeedDesire` - `0` *(constant)*
- `Priority` -  `Priority` *(constant)*

## AvoidGroundComponent

- `BaseData`
    - `MaxDistance` - Maximum distance where a hit will be detected.
    - `DirectionStrength` - Multiplies `DirectionDesire`.
    - `Priority` - Priority.
