# Follow Path Spline

Makes the entity follow a given spline path. The path is set up as [`SplineContainer`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.splines@2.0/api/UnityEngine.Splines.SplineContainer.html). A scene using this behavior must have a single instance of `FollowPathSplineManager`, which holds references `SplineContainer`. The spline to use is selected using the `FollowPathSplineIndex`. For a sample that uses this behavior, see [2D Movement Sample](/docs/samples/2_2d-movement) scene.

## FollowPathSplineJob

The behavior affects both direction and the speed. This behavior is unusual from the others, because it uses an additional [system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.3/manual/concepts-systems.html), the `FollowPathSplineSystem`. The system updates `FollowPathSplineComponent.Dir`, which is a direction either along the curve, or perpendicularly towards the curve if the entity is too far from it. The behavior then returns `FollowPathSplineComponent.Dir` at constant speed with constant desire.

This behavior outputs the following: 
- `DesiredDirection` - Direction `FollowPathSplineComponent.Dir`, along the curve or towards it.
- `DirectionDesire` - `DirectionStrength` *(constant)*
- `DesiredSpeed` - `Speed` *(constant)*
- `SpeedDesire` - `SpeedStrength` *(constant)*
- `Priority` -  `Priority` *(constant)*

## FollowPathComponent

The main interesting properties to adjust on [`FollowPathComponent`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/simple-behaviors/follow-path#followpathcomponent) are:
- `Speed` - How fast the entity should travel.
- `DistanceThreshold` - Threshold distance to curve, where the entity moves purely **along** the curve.
- `DistanceThresholdWidth` - At distance `DistanceThreshold + DistanceThresholdWidth` to curve, the entity moves purely **towards** the curve.
- `Power` - Power for blending between direction along and towards the curve as distance increases.
- `Loops` - Should the entity loop around the path.
- `LookAhead` - How far ahead should the entity look when looking for a nearest point on the curve.
- `BaseData`
    - `DirectionStrength` - Determines `DirectionDesire`.
    - `Priority` - Priority.


## FollowPathSplineIndex

This component holds index into the array of splines in `FollowPathSplineManager`. The entity will use the path under the specified index. The index can be set in the `FollowPathSplineAuthoring`.
