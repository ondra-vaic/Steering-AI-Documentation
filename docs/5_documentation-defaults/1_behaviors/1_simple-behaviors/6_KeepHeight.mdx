# Keep Height

Makes the entities stay within a specified range of `y` coordinates. It can be for example useful to restrict how high the entities will fly.

## KeepHeightJob

This behavior outputs the following: 
- `DesiredDirection` - Direction up or down back to the zone if `y` is outside `MinY` and `MaxY`.
- `DirectionDesire` - From `0` to `DirectionStrength` as distance from either boundaries goes from `0` to `CalmZoneHeight`.
- `DesiredSpeed` - `0` *(constant)*
- `SpeedDesire` - `0` *(constant)*
- `Priority` -  `Priority` *(constant)*

## KeepHeightComponent

The main interesting properties to adjust on `KeepHeightComponent` are:
- `MaxY` - Maximum y coordinate of the entity.
- `MinY` - Minimum y coordinate of the entity.
- `CalmZoneHeight` - At this distance from either boundary, the behavior has maximum effect.
- `BaseData`
    - `DirectionStrength` - Multiplies `DirectionDesire`.
    - `Priority` - Priority.
