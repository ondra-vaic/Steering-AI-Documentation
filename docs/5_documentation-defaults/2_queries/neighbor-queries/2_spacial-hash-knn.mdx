# Spacial Hash KNN

For each entity finds maximum of `MaxNumNeighbors` within radius `MaxNeighborDistance`. It's also possible to limit the field of view with `MaxFOV`. Functionally it is exactly the same as [`KDTreeKNNJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/neighbor-queries/kd-tree-knn). The only difference is in the data structure used. Usually, spacial hashing provides better performance, but proper profiling is always necessary.

:::tip
[Neighbor queries](/docs/documentation-core/queries/neighbor_queries/overview) can easily cost most of the resources needed to run a steering system. Try to limit the `MaxNumNeighbors` and `MaxNeighborDistance` to minimum.
