# KD Tree KNN

For each entity finds maximum of `MaxNumNeighbors` within radius `MaxNeighborDistance`. It's also possible to limit the field of view with `MaxFOV`. Functionally it is exactly the same as [`SpacialHashKNNJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/neighbor-queries/spacial-hash-knn). The only difference is in the data structure used. Usually, [`SpacialHashKNNJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/neighbor-queries/spacial-hash-knn) provides better performance, but proper profiling is always necessary.

*The code is based on public [github repository](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/KNN) by [ArthurBrussee](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee).*

:::tip
[Neighbor queries](/docs/documentation-core/queries/neighbor_queries/overview) can easily cost most of the resources needed to run a steering system. Try to limit the `MaxNumNeighbors` to minimum.
