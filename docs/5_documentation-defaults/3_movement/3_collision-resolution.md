# Collision Resolution

To resolve collisions with the environment, there is an implementation of [collide and slide algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR6Q7dUz2uk). The system `CollideAndSlideSystem` implements it. To use it, add the `KinematicBodyAuthoring` which adds the `CollideAndSlideComponent`.

The `KinematicBodyAuthoring` has the following properties:

- `IsActive` - 
- `SkinWidth` - 
- `LayerMask` - 
- `Debug` -
