To resolve collisions with the environment, there is an implementation of collide and slide algorithm [link]. The system `CollideAndSlideSystem` implements it. To use it, add the `KinematicBodyAuthoring` which adds the `CollideAndSlideComponent`.

- `IsActive` - 
- `SkinWidth` - 
- `LayerMask` - 
- `Debug` -
