# Overview

Movement systems take the entity's current velocity [`VelocityComponent`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/steering-entity) and its desired velocity [`DesiredVelocityComponent`](/docs/documentation-defaults/merger#desiredvelocitycomponent) and update its `VelocityComponent`. Each movement system has a component where properties like acceleration can be adjusted. 

## Movement

There are three movement systems implemented. One for [2D](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/0_2D-movement), one for flying in [3D](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/1_3D-movement) and [2,5D](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/2_25D-movement) for walking on [`Collider`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.html)s like terrain. To use one of the movement systems, add any of these authorings:

- [`Movement2DAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/0_2D-movement) - Adds `Movement2DComponent` used by `Move2DSystem`.
- [`Movement3DAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/1_3D-movement) - Adds `Movement3DComponent` used by `Move3DSystem`.
- [`Movement25DAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/2_25D-movement) - Adds `Movement25DComponent` used by `Move25DSystem`.

:::note
Each movement authoring also adds a `MaxSpeedComponent` component. The maximum speeds of entities are passed into all behaviors inside [`BaseBehaviorParams`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseBehaviorParams). 
:::

## Collision Resolution
To resolve collisions with [`Collider`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.html)s in the scene, [`CollideAndSlideSystem`](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/collision-resolution) can be used with any of the movement systems. To use collision resolution add [`KinematicBodyAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-defaults/movement/collision-resolution).
