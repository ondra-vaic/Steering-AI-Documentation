# Box Limiter

The `BoxLimiterSystem` wraps the position of entities to the other side of a box area. The system will do this for all entities with a `BoxLimiterComponent`. The size of the box can be set on the component in it's `Size` property. This system was used in the [2D flocking sample](/docs/samples/flocking#2-2d).
