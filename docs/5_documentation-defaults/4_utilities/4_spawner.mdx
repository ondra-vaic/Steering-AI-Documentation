# Spawners

Spawners can be used to spawn large numbers of entities.

## Sphere Spawner

`SpawnerAuthoring` can be attached to a game object to spawn entities in random positions of some spherical area. The system responsible for this is the `SpawnerSystem`. It spawns the entities in a radius around the game object with `SpawnerAuthoring`.

You can set the following properties on `SpawnerAuthoring`.

- `Prefab` - Prefab of an entity to spawn.
- `Count` - How many to spawn.
- `Radius` - Radius of the area where entities can spawn.
- `PositionMask` - Multiplier for the random positions - for example `float3(1, 0, 1)` will make a circle, `float3(1, 1, 1)` a sphere and `float3(1, 0.1, 1)` would make a sphere squashed on y axis.


## Rect Spawner

`RectSpawnerAuthoring` can be attached to a game object to spawn entities evenly distributed inside a rectangular area. The system which does this is the `RectSpawnerSystem`. It spawns the entities in a rectangular area around the game object with `RectSpawnerAuthoring`.

You can set the following properties on `RectSpawnerAuthoring`.

- `Prefab` - Prefab of an entity to spawn.
- `Count` - How many to spawn.
- `Size` - Size of the rectangle.
