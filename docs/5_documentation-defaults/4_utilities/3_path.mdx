# Paths

Paths are used by the [`FollowPathJob`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/simple-behaviors/follow-path) behavior. For this behavior to work, an instance of `IPathPoints` has to be assigned into the entity's `FollowPathAuthoring`. 

## PathPoints

`PathPoints` can be attached to a game object in the scene. It contains an ordered list of `Transform` which is visualized in the scene view. 

## MultiPath

`MultiPath` can be used to connect multiple paths. It contains an ordered list of `PathPoints` which is visualized in the scene view.
