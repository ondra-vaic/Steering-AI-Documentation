*Flocking with 3D movement.*

This sample shows set up of flocking for all three movement types. Flocking here is the combination of three behaviors - *Alignment*, *Cohesion*, and *Separation* [link]. All these behaviors are included in the framework [link]. 

The first folder - *1. Behaviors* contains a scene for each behavior where the behavior is visualized and a scene where the combination of the behaviors is visualized. These samples are in folder *1. Behaviors*. Then there is a sample scene with flocking for each movement system. For example folder *2. 2D*.

    ### 2D Movement
    
    In this scene you can toggle multiple different subscenes which have different setups of `CohesionAuthoring`, `AlignmentAuthoring`, `SeparationAuthoring`. If the entities go over a border set on `BoxLimiterAuthoring`, the entity is teleported to the oposite side.

    ### 3D Movement
    
    In this scene there are three different subscenes containing flocks of different sizes. The larger flock has a more optimized, but simpler neighbor query. This scene also shows usefullness of `HomingJobWrapper` which makes the entities stay withing a given areas. In the subscenes, the larger the flocks, the larger the homing radii on the `HomingComponents`.

    ### 2.5D Movement
    
    This scene shows a flock set up on terrain, bordered by walls. The walls are a third option so far to constraint the entities within an area. The previous two options were `BoxLimiterSystem` and `MultiHomingJobWrapper`.
