*Entity following a path along terrain smoothly.*

This sample shows usage of `Move25DSystem`. This system allows movement on ground. Paired with `CollideAndSlideSystem` it is similar to Unity's `CharacterController`. It handles steps and gradual speeding up and down depending on whether the entity travels up- or down-hill. The `CollideAndSlideSystem`[link] makes sure the entity does not travel through colliders. It can be used with other *Movement Systems*, it's usage is described in the next sample [link].

    ### Subscene 1
    
    This subscene contains a large number of test cases and is ideal to experiment with different configurations of `Movement25DAuthoring`. In the scene, a path is set up through the whole course which an entity follows.

    ### Subscene 2
    
    This subscene shows different settings for `MaxAngleToSlide` and `StepHeight`. You can observe that lower values can cause the entities to get stuck in extreme cases.

    **Other Components**:
    - `SteeringEntityAuthoring`
    - `DesiredVelocityAuthoring`
    - `Movement25DAuthoring`
    - `KinematicBodyAuthoring`

    :::note
    Note the usage of `KinematicBodyAuthoring` this authoring is necessary to enable `CollideAndSlideSystem` [link]. The authoring allows you to customize `LayerMask` and `SkinWidth` used for collision resolution.
