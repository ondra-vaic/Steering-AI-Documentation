# Intro

**Steering AI** is a framework created for simple AI entities driven by steering behaviors. It is especially suitable for [flocking simulations](samples/flocking) or other group AI behaviors. The framework heavily utilizes multithreading through Unity's [Jobs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/job-system.html), [Burst Compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.8/manual/index.html) and [ECS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.3/manual/index.html) to achieve good preformance. 

The framework includes a [custom editor](/docs/documentation-core/editor) which can be used to set up AI simulations by designers in a simple and modular way. There is over 15 prepared [behaviors](/docs/category/behaviors-1) which can be used to set up without any code. This library of behaviors can be easily [extended](/docs/category/behaviors), even with no prior knowledge of [ECS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.3/manual/index.html), and [Jobs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/job-system.html). There is several [samples](/docs/category/samples) which can be followed in order as a tutorial to get familiar with using the framework. To gain even deeper understanding, visit the documentation of the [core framework](/docs/category/documentation-core) and library of the prepared [behaviors](/docs/category/behaviors-1).
