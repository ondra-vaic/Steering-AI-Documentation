# Intro

**Steering AI** is a framework created for simple AI entities driven by Steering Behaviors. It is especially suitable for [flocking simulations](samples/flocking) or other group AI behaviors. The framework heavily utilizes multithreading through Unity's Jobs, Burst Compiler and ECS to achieve good preformance. 

The framework includes a custom editor [custom editor](documentation-core/editor) which can be used to set up AI simulations by designers in a simple and modular way. There is over 15 prepared [behaviors](category/behaviors-1) which can be used to set up without any code. This library of behaviors can be easily [extended](category/behaviors), even with no prior knowledge of ECS, and Jobs. There is several [samples](category/samples) which can be followed in order as a tutorial to get familiar with using the framework. To gain even deeper understanding, visit the documentation of the [core framework](category/documentation-core) and library of the prepared [behaviors](category/behaviors-1).
