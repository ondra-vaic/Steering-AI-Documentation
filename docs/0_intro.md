# Intro

**Steering AI** is a framework created for simple AI entities driven by Steering Behaviors. It is especially suitable for flocking simulations [link] or other group AI behaviors. The framework heavily utilizes multithreading through Unity's Jobs, Burst Compiler and ECS to achieve excellent preformance. 

The framework includes a custom editor [link] which can be used to set up AI simulations by designers in a simple and modular way. There is over 15 prepared behaviors which can be used to set up without any code [link]. This library of behaviors can be easily extended [link], even with no prior knowledge of ECS, and Jobs. There is several samples [link] which can be followed in order as a tutorial to get familiar with using the framework. To gain even deeper understanding, visit the documentation of the core framework [link] and the library of the behaviors [link].
