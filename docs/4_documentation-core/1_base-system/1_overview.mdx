# Overview

`BaseSteeringSystem` is a base class which can be inherited to create a steering system. It is configurable by `SteeringSystemAsset` which can be edited through the editor [link]. It contains definition of which jobs with which queries to run. The base class is responsible for these scheduling jobs and queries and passing data between them.

First entities with the same **Main Tag** are queried with an **Entity Query**. This is passed to all **Simple-, Neighbor-, Raycast Behaviors**. All **Simple Behaviors** are simply ran in parallel and their results passed into the **Combiner**. For **Neighbor Behaviors** and **Raycast Behaviors** there are additional **Queries** done first. Also these behaviors can be in multiple groups based on the additional queries. After the **Combiner** receives results from all behaviors, it combines them into a single `Desired Velocity` for each entity, which can later be used by any **Move System**.
