# BaseSteeringSystem

`BaseSteeringSystem` is a base class which can be inherited to create a steering system. It is configurable by `SteeringSystemAsset` which can be edited through the editor [link]. It contains definition of which jobs with which queries to run. The base class is responsible for these scheduling jobs and queries and passing data between them. 

## Usage

To create a new steering system, inherit from `BaseSteeringSystem` and override the `getAssetReferenceName()` method to return the addressable path to the `SteeringSystemAsset` to use. 

```csharp title="SampleSteeringSystem.cs"
using SteeringAI.Core;
using Unity.Entities;

[UpdateInGroup(typeof(SteeringSystemsGroup))]
public partial class SampleSteeringSystem : BaseSteeringSystem
{
    protected override string getAssetReferenceName()
    {
        return "Path/To/SteeringSystemAsset.asset";
    }
}
```

## Overview

The image below illustrates what `BaseSteeringSystem` does internally. 

1) First entities with the same **Main Tag** are queried with an **Entity Query**. Information from these entities is extracted into `BaseBehaviorParams`. 

2) This is passed to all **Simple-, Neighbor-, Raycast Behaviors**. All **Simple Behaviors** are simply ran in parallel and their results passed into the **Combiner**. For **Neighbor Behaviors** and **Raycast Behaviors** there are additional **Queries** done first. These behaviors can be in grouped by the additional queries. 

3) After the **Combiner** receives results from all behaviors, it combines them into a single result for each entity, which can later be used by any **Move System**.

:::note
In the defaults library, all behaviors return `VelocityResult` and a combiner turns it into a `DesiredVelocityComponent`. It is however possible to create your own workflows. This is defined through the implementation of combiner.
