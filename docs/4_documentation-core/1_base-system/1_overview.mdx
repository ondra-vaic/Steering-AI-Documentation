# Overview

The core of the library is the [`BaseSteeringSystem`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseSteeringSystem). It loads a [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset) which declaratively defines how entities should behave through [queries](/docs/category/queries) and [behaviors](/docs/category/behaviors) which are implemented as parallel [jobs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/job-system.html). The [system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.3/manual/concepts-systems.html) then runs these jobs to determine where each entity wants to go. Each entity participating in the simulation must be initialized with [`SteeringEntityAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/steering-entity).
