# Overview

The core of the library is the `BaseSteeringSystem`. It loads a `SteeringSystemAsset` which declaratively defines how entities should behave through instances of queries and behaviors [links] which are implemented as parallel jobs. The system then runs these jobs to determine where each entity wants to go. Each entity participating in the simulation must be initialized with `SteeringEntityAuthoring`.
