# Overview

The core of the library is the [`BaseSteeringSystem`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseSteeringSystem). It loads a [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset) which declaratively defines how entities should behave through instances of queries and behaviors [links] which are implemented as parallel jobs. The system then runs these jobs to determine where each entity wants to go. Each entity participating in the simulation must be initialized with [`SteeringEntityAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/steering-entity).
