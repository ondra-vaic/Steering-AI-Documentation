# BaseSteeringSystem

[`BaseSteeringSystem`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseSteeringSystem) is a base class inheriting from [`SystemBase`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.3/manual/systems-systembase.html) which can be inherited to create a steering system. It is configurable by [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset) which can be edited through the [editor](/docs/documentation-core/editor). It contains definition of which jobs with which queries to run. The base class is responsible for these scheduling [jobs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/job-system.html) and [queries](/docs/category/queries) and passing data between them. 

## Usage

To create a new steering system, inherit from [`BaseSteeringSystem`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseSteeringSystem) and override the `getAssetReferenceName()` method to return the addressable path to the [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset) to use. 

```csharp title="SampleSteeringSystem.cs"
using SteeringAI.Core;
using Unity.Entities;

[UpdateInGroup(typeof(SteeringSystemsGroup))]
public partial class SampleSteeringSystem : BaseSteeringSystem
{
    protected override string getAssetReferenceName()
    {
        return "Path/To/SteeringSystemAsset.asset";
    }
}
```

## What It Does

The image below illustrates what [`BaseSteeringSystem`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseSteeringSystem) does internally. 

1) First entities with the same **Main Tag** are queried with an [**Entity Query**](/docs/documentation-core/queries/entity-queries). Information from these entities is extracted into [`BaseBehaviorParams`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseBehaviorParams). 

2) This is passed to all **[Simple-](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/simple-behaviors/overview), [Neighbor-](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/intro), [Raycast Behaviors](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/ray-behaviors/overview)**. All [**Simple Behaviors**](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/simple-behaviors/overview) are simply ran in parallel and their results passed into the [**Combiner**](/docs/documentation-core/combiner). For [**Neighbor Behaviors**](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/intro) and [**Raycast Behaviors**](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/ray-behaviors/overview) there are additional [**Queries**](/docs/category/queries) done first. These behaviors can be in grouped by the additional queries. 

3) After the [**Combiner**](/docs/documentation-core/combiner) receives results from all behaviors, it combines them into a single result for each entity, which can later be used by any [**Move System**](/docs/category/movement).

:::note
In the [defaults library](/docs/category/documentation-defaults), all [behaviors](/docs/category/behaviors-1) return [`VelocityResult`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult) and a combiner turns it into a [`DesiredVelocityComponent`](/docs/documentation-defaults/Combiner#desiredvelocitycomponent). It is however possible to create your own workflows. This is defined through the implementation of [combiner](/docs/documentation-core/combiner).
