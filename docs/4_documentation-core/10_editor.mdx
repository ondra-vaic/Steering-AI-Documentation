# Editor

The editor for the [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset) let's you set up a system which controls entities. The system is set up modularly from behaviors. To open the editor, double click on any [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset).

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="1" label="Top Area"> 
    
    At the top, you can see the name of currently opened [steering system asset](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset). On the right, a prefab for entity intended for this system should be assigned. This prefab needs to have [`SteeringEntityAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/steering-entity). On the left is the [tag](/docs/documentation-core/components/Tags) which will be queried by this systems main [entity query](/docs/documentation-core/queries/entity-queries). Only entities with this tag will be processed by this system.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="2" label="Right Area"> 
    This list shows which [components](/docs/documentation-core/components/intro) should be attached to the entity. The components can be added or removed on the prefab with the plus and minus buttons. The list is determined from the set of used [behaviors](/docs/category/behaviors). Each behavior declares which components it needs through [attributes](/docs/documentation-core/attributes).

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="3" label="Simple Behaviors"> 
    [Simple behaviors](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/simple-behaviors/overview) can be simply added from the `behaviors` dropdown into the list of behaviors. Here the list contains [`GoForwardJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/simple-behaviors/go-foward) and [`WanderingJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/simple-behaviors/wandering).

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="4" label="Neighbor Behaviors"> 
    [Neighbor behaviors](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/intro) are grouped by [neighbor queries](/docs/documentation-core/queries/neighbor_queries/overview). This let's multiple behaviors reuse the same neighbor query, saving performance. In the image below is one neighbor behavior group which contains one single neighbor behavior. 

    <img src="/img/core/Editor/N3.png" alt="Description of the image"/>

    #### Neighbor Query
    In this section, you can select the implementation of a [neighbor query](/docs/documentation-core/queries/neighbor_queries/overview) and set it up. Here it's at most 7 (nearest) neighbors, at maximum distance of 10 units while considering full field of view - 360 degrees. The selected query below is [`KDTreeKNNJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/neighbor-queries/kd-tree-knn).

    <img src="/img/core/Editor/N4.png" alt="Description of the image"/>


    #### Neighbor Behaviors
    This is where the [neighbor behaviors](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/intro) can be added from the `Behaviors` dropdown into the list of behaviors.

    <img src="/img/core/Editor/N1.png" alt="Description of the image"/>

    #### Neighbors' Components
    This section shows which components the neighbors should have on them. The `required` section contains components which **must** be on the neighbors. For example when using [`MultiHomingJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/simple-behaviors/homing), the entities which represent homes **must** have the [`HomeComponent`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/multi-homing#homecomponent) on them. The upper section is where [tags](/docs/documentation-core/components/Tags) determining which entities are potential neighbors can be added. A potential neighbor will be an entity with at least one of these tags.

    <TabItem value="5" label="Ray Behaviors"> 
    
    [Ray behaviors](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/ray-behaviors/overview) are grouped by [ray queries](/docs/documentation-core/queries/ray_queries/overview) to reuse their results. In the image below is one ray behavior group which contains one ray behavior. 

    <img src="/img/core/Editor/Ray1.png" alt="Description of the image"/>

    #### Ray Query
    In this section, you can select the implementation of a [ray query](/docs/documentation-core/queries/ray_queries/overview) and set it up. Here it's 20 rays, at maximum distance 10 units, intersecting with any [layer](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html). The selected query below is [`Sweep2DCreateRaysJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/ray-queries/sweep-2D-create-rays). 

    <img src="/img/core/Editor/Ray4.png" alt="Description of the image"/>

    #### Ray Behaviors
    Here the [ray behaviors](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/ray-behaviors/overview) can be added from the `Behaviors` dropdown into the list of behaviors.

    <img src="/img/core/Editor/Ray3.png" alt="Description of the image"/>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="6" label="Combiner"> 
        This section is only interesting if you implement your custom [combiner](/docs/documentation-core/combiner), which can then be selected here. Selecting the combiner makes all the behavior dropdowns only show behaviors with [output type](/docs/documentation-core/attributes#outdataattribute) compatible to the input type of the combiner. With the default [`CombineVelocitiesJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/Combiner) the compatible input type is [`VelocityResults`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult), which is the output type of all [default behaviors](/docs/category/behaviors-1).
