# Overview

Neighbor queries find *k* neighbors of each entity. The image below shows a [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset) with one group of [*neighbor behaviors*](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/intro). The selected [neighbor query](/docs/documentation-core/queries/neighbor_queries/neighbor-queries) here is [`KDTreeKNNJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/neighbor-queries/kd-tree-knn). It finds at most `MaxNumNeighbors` of neighbors which are less than `MaxNeighborDistance` units away. `MaxFOV` can be used to specify the field of view of each entity. In this case, the query only considers entities with `_6_SampleBehaviorsTagComponent`, here it's the same [tag](/docs/documentation-core/components/Tags) as the *Main Tag*, but generally they can be different. It is also possible to add more tags. In that case a potential neighbor must have at least one of these tags.

[`KDTreeKNNJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/queries/neighbor-queries/kd-tree-knn) is selected as implementation of [neighbor query](/docs/documentation-core/queries/neighbor_queries/neighbor-queries) which will search among entities tagged with `_6_SampleBehaviorsTagComponent`.*

:::tip
[`DebugNeighborsJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/debug-neigbhors) can help to visualize a neighbor query, as in the video.
