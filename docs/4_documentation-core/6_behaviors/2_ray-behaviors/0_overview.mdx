# Overview

The result of ray behaviors depends on an entity and the ray casts created by the *Ray Query*. The entity can have a component which parametrizes this behavior. For example `EnvironmentAvoidanceJobWrapper` depends on `EnvironmentAvoidanceComponent`. The behaviors can be grouped together by the *Ray Query*.

*Image of `SteeringSystemAsset` with two ray groups. The group given by the `ConeCreateRaysJobWrapper` ray query, contains the behaviors `EnvironmentAvoidanceJobWrapper` and `AvoidVerticalWallsJobWrapper`. The other group is given by `DownSingleCreateRayJobWrapper` and `AvoidGroundJobWrapper`. The components which these behaviors depend on are added to the list on the right.*
