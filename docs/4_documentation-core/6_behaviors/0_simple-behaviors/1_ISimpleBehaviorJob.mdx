# ISimpleBehaviorJobWrapper

Simple behaviors are implementations of `ISimpleBehaviorJobWrapper`. The `BaseSystem` schedules them after querying the entities with the main entity query. There are three interfaces relevant in creating a simple behavior. The most important one is a custom job `ISimpleBehaviorJob<C, R>` which significantly simplifies creating the behaviors. 

- `ISimpleBehaviorJobWrapper` 
    - `Schedule` should schedule a job which writes `VelocityResult`s to `results`
- `ISimpleBehaviorJob<C, R>` 
    - `Execute` method should return a single `VelocityResult`
- `ISimpleBaseBehavior` 
    - entities used by `ISimpleBehaviorJob<C, R>` must have a component implementing this interface


## Implementing ISimpleBehaviorJobWrapper

Below is the implementation of the `GoForwardJobWrapper`. It can be easily used as a template to create your own behavior. The `Schedule` method receives information about the entities inside `BaseBehaviorParams`. It should allocate an object of the type specified in `OutDataAttribute` and assign it to `out results`. The behavior should write one `VelocityResult` per entity into `VelocityResults`. Here the `GoForwardJob` is resposible for that.

```csharp title="GoForwardJobWrapper.cs"
[JobWrapper(typeof(GoForwardComponent))]
[OutData(typeof(VelocityResults))]
public class GoForwardJobWrapper : ISimpleBehaviorJobRunner
{
    public JobHandle Schedule(
        SystemBase systemBase,
        in BaseBehaviorParams baseBehaviorParams,
        out IDelayedDisposable results,
        in JobHandle dependency)
    {
        // Create new object to hold the results, should be same as declared in OutData
        results = new VelocityResults(baseBehaviorParams.EntityCount);
            
        // Scheduling GoForwardJob
        var outDependency = new GoForwardJob
        {
        }.Schedule<GoForwardJob, GoForwardComponent, VelocityResult>(
            systemBase,
            baseBehaviorParams,
            (VelocityResults)results,
            1,
            dependency);
            
        return outDependency;
    }
}
```

### Attributes

This job wrapper uses two attributes. First declares what type of object the behavior returns. Second declares which components are expected on the entity. The types from the attributes are used in the editor of the `SteeringSystemAsset`. 

- `OutDataAttribute` - *declares what type of results the behavior creates, above `VelocityResults`*
- `JobWrapperAttribute` - *declares which components should be present on the entity, above `GoForwardComponent`*

## ISimpleBehaviorJob\<C, R\>

`ISimpleBehaviorJob<C, R>` simplifies creation of new simple behaviors. For each entity, the `Execute` is called once, passing in information about the entity in the `behaviorData` parameter. The method returns a result of type `R`. Internally the result is then written into the `results`. 

### Generic Parameters

- `C` - *type of component expected on the main entities - should match the argument of `JobWrapper`*
- `R` - *type of result returned from the behavior - should match the argument of `OutData`*

```csharp title="GoForwardJobWrapper.cs"
[BurstCompile]
struct GoForwardJob : ISimpleBehaviorJob<GoForwardComponent, VelocityResult>
{
    public VelocityResult Execute(EntityInformation<GoForwardComponent> entity)
    // highlight-start
    {
        // Create a new result, implement your own behavior here instead
        var result = new VelocityResult(
            entity.Forward,                                 // Going forward in the current facing direction
            entity.Component.BaseData.DirectionStrength,    // How much I want to go in that direction
            entity.Component.Speed,                         // At what speed I want to go in that direction
            entity.Component.BaseData.SpeedStrength,        // How much I want to go at that speed
            entity.Component.BaseData.Priority);            // The priority of this behavior
            
        return result;
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

:::tip
You can just copy and paste this, then change all occurences of `GoForward` to `MyBehaviorName` to create a new behavior quickly. The only thing to implement is the `Execute` method.
