# Overview

The result of neighbor behaviors depends on an entity, and it's neighbors given by the *Neighbor Query*. Both the entity and the neighbors can have a component which parametrize the behavior. For example [`CohesionJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/cohesion) depends on [`CohesionAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/cohesion#cohesioncomponent) on the entity and [`SteeringEntityTagComponent`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/steering-entity) on the neighbors. [`[SteeringEntityTag]`](/docs/documentation-core/attributes#steeringentitytagattribute) is used because this behavior does not need any special data and any entity in the simulation will have this tag. Any component which is required on the neighbor will show up in the *All/(required)* section of the neighbor group. This can be seen in the image below.

*Image of a [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset) with [`CohesionJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/cohesion) and two other neighbor behaviors. On the right, the [`CohesionAuthoring`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/cohesion#cohesioncomponent) and others are added to the list of dependencies. In the neighbor group under *All/(required)*, [`SteeringEntityTagComponent`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/steering-entity) is shown as a dependency for the neighbors.*
