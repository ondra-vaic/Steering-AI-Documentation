# INeighborBehaviorJobWrapper

Neighbor behaviors are implementations of `INeighborBehaviorJobWrapper`. The [`BaseSteeringSystem`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/BaseSteeringSystem) schedules them after their corresponding [neighbor query](/docs/documentation-core/queries/neighbor_queries/overview) is done, passing in its results. There are three interfaces relevant in creating a neighbor behavior. The most important one is a [custom job](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.jobs@0.0/manual/custom_job_types.html) `INeighborBehaviorJob<C1, C2, A, R>` which significantly simplifies creating the behaviors. 

- [`INeighborBehaviorJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/#implementing-ineighborbehaviorjobwrapper) 
    - `Schedule` should schedule a job which writes [`VelocityResult`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult)s to `results`.
- [`INeighborBehaviorJob<C1, C2, A, R>`](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/#implementing-ineighborbehaviorjobc1-c2-a-r)
    - `Finalize` should return a single [`VelocityResult`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult).
    -  `Execute` runs once per each entity neighbor pair.
- [`INeighborBaseBehavior`](/docs/documentation-core/components/INeighborBaseBehavior)
    - Entities used by `INeighborBehaviorJob<C1, C2, A, R>` must have a component implementing this interface.

## Implementing INeighborBehaviorJobWrapper

Below is the implementation of the [`DebugNeighborsJobWrapper`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/debug-neigbhors). It can be easily used as a template to create your own behavior. The `Schedule` method receives information about the entities as well as it's neighbors inside `NeighborBehaviorParams`. It should allocate an object of the type specified in [`[OutData]`](/docs/documentation-core/attributes#outdataattribute) and assign it to `out results`. The behavior should write one [`VelocityResult`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult) per entity into [`VelocityResults`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult). Here the [`DebugNeighborsJob`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/debug-neigbhors) is resposible for that.

```csharp title="DebugNeighborsJobWrapper.cs"
[JobWrapper(typeof(DebugNeighborsComponent), typeof(SteeringEntityTagComponent))]
[OutData(typeof(VelocityResults))]
class DebugNeighborsJobWrapper : INeighborBehaviorJobWrapper
{
    public JobHandle Schedule(
        SystemBase systemBase,
        in NeighborBehaviorParams neighborBehaviorParams,
        out IDelayedDisposable results,
        in JobHandle dependency)
    {	
        results = new VelocityResults(neighborBehaviorParams.BaseBehaviorParams.EntityCount);
        var outDependency = new DebugNeighborsJob().Schedule<
            DebugJob, 
            DebugNeighborsComponent, 
            SteeringEntityTagComponent, 
            NoneAccumulator, 
            VelocityResult>(systemBase, neighborBehaviorParams, (VelocityResults)results, 1, dependency);
        return outDependency;
    }
}
```

### Attributes

This job wrapper uses two [attributes](/docs/documentation-core/attributes). First declares what type of object the behavior returns. Second declares which components are expected on the entity and it's neighbor. The types from the attributes are used in the [editor](/docs/documentation-core/editor) of the [`SteeringSystemAsset`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/SteeringSystemAsset). 

- [`[OutData]`](/docs/documentation-core/attributes#outdataattribute) - Declares what type of results the behavior creates, above [`VelocityResults`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult).
- [`[JobWrapper]`](/docs/documentation-core/attributes#jobwrapperattribute) - Declares which components should be present on the entity and neighbor respectively, above [`DebugNeighborsComponent`](/docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/debug-neigbhors#debugneighborscomponent) and [`SteeringEntityTagComponent`](/docs/documentation-core/base-system/steering-entity).

The correct way to match the type arguments with generic parameters to `INeighborBehaviorJob<C1, C2, A, R>` is the following:

- `[JobWrapper(typeof(C1), typeof(C2))]`
- `[OutData(typeof(R))]`

## Implementing INeighborBehaviorJob\<C1, C2, A, R\>

`INeighborBehaviorJob<C1, C2, A, R>` simplifies creation of new neighbor behaviors. For each entity, the `Execute` is called up to `MaxNumNeighbors` times, once for each neighbor. Information about the entity and it's neighbor are passed in the `behaviorData` parameter. It has one component from both of the entities, depending on the generics. The `Execute` method also receives reference to an [accumulator](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/accumulators). After influence of all neighbors is accumulated into the accumulator, it is passed with information about the entity into the `Finalize` method. That then returns a single result of type `R` per entity. Internally the result is then written into the `results`. 

### Generic Parameters

- `C1` - Type of component on the main entities implements [`INeighborBaseBehavior`](/docs/documentation-core/components/INeighborBaseBehavior).
- `C2` - Type of component on the neighbors.
- `A` - Type of [accumulator](/docs/documentation-core/behaviors/accumulators) passed into the `Exectute` method.
- `R` - Type of result returned from the behavior.

```csharp title="DebugNeighborsJobWrapper.cs"
[BurstCompile]
struct DebugNeighborsJob : INeighborBehaviorJob<
    DebugNeighborsComponent, 
    SteeringEntityTagComponent, 
    NoneAccumulator, 
    VelocityResult>
{
    public void Execute(
        in NeighborBehaviorData<DebugNeighborsComponent, SteeringEntityTagComponent> behaviorData,
        ref NoneAccumulator accumulator)
    // highlight-start
    {
        // Accumulate something about the neighbors into the accumulator
        Debug.DrawLine(behaviorData.Entity.Position, behaviorData.OtherEntity.Position);
    }
    // highlight-end

    // highlight-start
    public VelocityResult Finalize(
        in EntityInformation<DebugNeighborsComponent> entity,
        in NoneAccumulator accumulator)
    // highlight-start
    {
        // Based on the accumulator, return a VelocityResult which tells which way to go
        return default;
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

:::tip
You can just copy and paste this, then change all occurences of `DebugNeighbors` to `MyBehaviorName` to create a new behavior quickly. The only two things to implement are the `Execute` and `Finalize` methods. See other [default behaviors](/docs/category/neighbor-behaviors-1) to understand more complex examples.
