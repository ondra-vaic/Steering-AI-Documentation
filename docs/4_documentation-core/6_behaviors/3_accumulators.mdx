# Accumulators

One accumulator is created for each entity. It can be used to accumulate some result over all the neighbors. For example find the closest one, or find the centroid of their position as in `CohesionJob`. 

They allow each entity to accumulate some information about all the raycasts, for example finding the closest hit.
