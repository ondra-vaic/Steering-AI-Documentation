# Steering Entity Authoring

Any entity to be use with the framework should use `SteeringEntityAuthoring`. It adds components which are used internally by the framework. The components are: 

- `VelocityComponent` - Tracks the current velocity of the entity.
- `RadiusComponent` - Determines the entity's radius. (Used to determine distance to other entities, and for collisions.)
- `SteeringEntityTagComponent` - Marks the entity as being used with the framework.
- `IsSimulatingTagComponent` - Marks the entity to be simulated by the framework.
- User defined tags added through the editor.
