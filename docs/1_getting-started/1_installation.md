# Installation

Steering AI is split into three parts. 
- **Core** - This is the core of the framework. It handles creation of the Steering System Assets [link] through the editor [link] as well as scheduling all of its behavior jobs. The core must always be imported into the project.
- **Defaults** - Contains implementation of several behaviors [link] as well as movement systems [link] and other utilities. This will be most likely be useful to import into any project unless you want to create all your behaviors from scratch.
- **Samples** - Contains sample scenes [link] which showcase the usage of the framework with behaviors and movement systems from defaults.

Simply import with Unity Package Manager and select which parts you need. After getting familiar with the samples, feel free to remove them. [img]
