2D Movement -> Movement 2D


some samples probably miss other components section with SteeringEntityAuthoring
KeepSpeedJobWrapper - at least still in samples flocking - get rid of it
Base System -> BaseSteeringSystem
describe and link VelocityResultS in /docs/documentation-defaults/behaviors/VelocityResult
collision resolution - more description and fill in stuff for authoring
KinematicBodyAuthoring section
desriptions for all movement systems 
maybe intro to movement - mention max speed, desired velocity and velocity, then intro, and group movement systems into a folder
link editor everywhere
reflexive reference in behaviors
put everywhere in core links to defaults
bold letters and links in concepts?
link all samples to all behaviors, queries, movement in defaults
link custom job everywhere where mentioned?
put ref to velocity result into all defaults behaviors

FlockingEntityAuthoring to Steering in /docs/documentation-core/components/Tags
link ecs in concepts
link entity in concepts
link MaxSpeedComponent in SteeringEntityAuthoring
base behavior params link to ecs stuff
MaxAccumulator - description - not centroid
DebugaNeighborsComponent in /docs/documentation-core/behaviors/neighbor-behaviors/
mention `PathUpdateSystem` in path behavior
a bit more description into defaults/CollideAndSlideSystem, can take from samples
sample 5 - The algorithm is based on paper about numerically stable collide ....
sample 8 - missing screenshot of simple behaviors
link to unity entity query in core/entityquery
link to unity jobs in core/behaviors
section for core behaviors how are they set up
cite video from in core/neighbors/overview
core behaviors generic parameters descriptions as -implements, -matches as new -lines
write intro in all defaults behaviors and queries kinds - which job wrapper, which job, which component, which result


DOCS.last

check everywhere that components and behaviors arent just copied from somewhere
fix nothing after headline
check runner/wrapper
no name on code samples - no highlighting
Your browser does not support the video tag.
cleanup
visual
links

DOCS.FUTURE
add CreateRaysParams etc into core just like NeighborQueryParams
describe time scaler - utilities
describe IBehaviorResults and VelocityResults
describe somewhere you can put shared properties into job wrappers
... image for each behavior
Movement25d - all screenshots have mouse pointer
sub headlines for all categories

OTHER
reexport diagram image with good wording
go through all scenes and check prefabs, apply / rever overrides, check everything works
link this guy in code - https://www.jacksondunstan.com/articles/4857

EDITOR.FUTURE
handle somehow changing name, now there is some bug it seems
rename tag - warning in the window 
steering system window doesn't refresh when tag removed on entity

CODE

rename DebugableComponent

CODE.FUTURE
neighbor queries todos
path performance probably sucks
IBaseBehaviorData + INeighborBehavior data
no need to split into RayData and Commands, keep in other struct

OTHER.FUTURE
use the wandering desire thing?
Rotations for 3D might work with sterp, seems to work with 2.5D. Next time use forward as twist axis!!
check what is the performance difference if I use bssr = temp.MaxHeap.HeadValue;

BACKLOG
accelerate more based on sum desire * f(prio)?

NOTES
high direction on keep speed and homing helps with nice cohesive flocks

unity sphere and box corner collision detection bug
