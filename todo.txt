DOCS.imgs
add simple behavior screenshot for collisions sample
image for each "scene" in full example 
... image for each behavior
Movement25d - all screenshots have mouse pointer
intro image
defaults combiner image

DOCS.core

split generic parameters into a list and give example of accumulator
attributes
Describe creating a combiner
describe somewhere you can put shared properties into job wrappers
accumulators
ref each IBaseBehavior in the behavior sections in core

DOCS.other 

DOCS.last

check everywhere that components and behaviors arent just copied from somewhere
fix nothing after headline
check runner/wrapper
no name on code samples - no highlighting
Your browser does not support the video tag.
cleanup
visual
links

DOCS.FUTURE

describe time scaler - utilities

OTHER
reexport diagram image with good wording
go through all scenes and check prefabs, apply / rever overrides, check everything works

EDITOR.FUTURE
handle somehow changing name, now there is some bug it seems
rename tag - warning in the window 
steering system window doesn't refresh when tag removed on entity

CODE.FUTURE
neighbor queries todos
path performance probably sucks
IBaseBehaviorData + INeighborBehavior data

OTHER.FUTURE
use the wandering desire thing?
Rotations for 3D might work with sterp, seems to work with 2.5D. Next time use forward as twist axis!!
check what is the performance difference if I use bssr = temp.MaxHeap.HeadValue;

BACKLOG
accelerate more based on sum desire * f(prio)?

NOTES
high direction on keep speed and homing helps with nice cohesive flocks
