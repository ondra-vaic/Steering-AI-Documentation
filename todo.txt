CODE
- combiner rename
- create debug job for simple and ray behaviors
- 2.5d movement rename paths better and assign ref to the two new terrains and put collider on them
- fix no max distance for ray queries
- avoid vertical walls - put project on global up
- fix sheeps tag for predator group in the asset
- simple/single
- rename to INeighborBaseBehavior
- rename to INeighborQueryJobWrapper not runner
- rename AirForwardAlignmentSpeed
- delete cyllinderCreateRaysJob
- delete keep speed - it's same as go forward
- stepheight etc into walking section of properties
- add IsActive to Move2DSystem
- rename StartSpeedDiffFraction etc

DOCS

DOCS.imgs

add simple behavior screenshot for collisions sample
image for each "scene" in full example 
could split generic parameters and give example of accumulator into INeighborBehaviorJob etc
maybe find place for base behavior data
maybe mention IBaseBehavior in the behavior sections of core
Steering system asset in core
Describe creating a combiner
explain purpose of fov and max dist in base behavior
... image for each behavior
rename StartSpeedDiffFraction etc
accumulators into core
describe somewhere you can put shared properties into job wrappers
Your browser does not support the video tag.
intro and installation
describe time scale 
bird predator environment avoidance
NOT sheep environment avoidance instead of avoid vertical walls
STEERING_DEBUG
installation
change
core accumulators
Movement25d - all screenshots have mouse pointer

DOCS.FUTURE

OTHER
set up min speed and test it works
go through all scenes and check prefabs, apply / rever overrides, check everything works
reexport diagram image with good wording

EDITOR.FUTURE
handle somehow changing name, now there is some bug it seems
rename tag - warning in the window 
steering system window doesn't refresh when tag removed on entity

CODE.FUTURE
neighbor queries todos
path performance probably sucks

OTHER.FUTURE
use the wandering desire thing?
Rotations for 3D might work with sterp, seems to work with 2.5D. Next time use forward as twist axis!!
check what is the performance difference if I use bssr = temp.MaxHeap.HeadValue;

BACKLOG
accelerate more based on sum desire * f(prio)?

NOTES
high direction on keep speed and homing helps with nice cohesive flocks
