DOCS.IMAGES

social card in config
fav icon
images for the features


OTHER
reexport diagram image with good wording
go through all scenes and check prefabs, apply / rever overrides, check everything works

CODE

link this guy in code - https://www.jacksondunstan.com/articles/4857
rename DebugableComponent

------------------------------------ FUTURE ------------------------------------
DOCS.FUTURE
fix screenshots containing KeepSpeedBehavior
add CreateRaysParams etc into core just like NeighborQueryParams
describe time scaler - utilities
describe IBehaviorResults and VelocityResults
describe somewhere you can put shared properties into job wrappers
... image for each behavior
Movement25d - all screenshots have mouse pointer
sub headlines for all categories
add: an entity needs these components to work: VelocityComponent, MaxSpeedComponent.... in base steering system
full example is missing sections for prefabs
link all samples to all behaviors, queries, movement in defaults
flocking with predator is missing folder image

CODE.FUTURE
neighbor queries todos
path performance probably sucks
IBaseBehaviorData + INeighborBehavior data
no need to split into RayData and Commands, keep in other struct
put MaxSpeedComponent into base systems query
ICombineJobWrapper - IDelayedDisposable[] change to IBehaviorResults
Probably don't need RayCommand at all

EDITOR.FUTURE
handle somehow changing name, now there is some bug it seems
rename tag - warning in the window 
steering system window doesn't refresh when tag removed on entity

OTHER.FUTURE
use the wandering desire thing?
Rotations for 3D might work with sterp, seems to work with 2.5D. Next time use forward as twist axis!!
check what is the performance difference if I use bssr = temp.MaxHeap.HeadValue;

------------------------------------ NOTES ------------------------------------
BACKLOG
accelerate more based on sum desire * f(prio)?

NOTES
high direction on keep speed and homing helps with nice cohesive flocks

unity sphere and box corner collision detection bug
