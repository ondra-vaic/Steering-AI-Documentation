image for each "scene" in full example 
... image for each behavior
Movement25d - all screenshots have mouse pointer
intro image

DOCS.core

explain purpose of fov and max dist in base behavior
split generic parameters into a list and give example of accumulator
editor - put behaviors into tabs
attributes
describe base behavior data
describe base behavior params
ref each IBaseBehavior in the behavior sections in core
Describe creating a combiner
describe somewhere you can put shared properties into job wrappers

OTHER
reexport diagram image with good wording
go through all scenes and check prefabs, apply / rever overrides, check everything works

EDITOR.FUTURE
handle somehow changing name, now there is some bug it seems
rename tag - warning in the window 
steering system window doesn't refresh when tag removed on entity

CODE.FUTURE
neighbor queries todos
path performance probably sucks

OTHER.FUTURE
use the wandering desire thing?
Rotations for 3D might work with sterp, seems to work with 2.5D. Next time use forward as twist axis!!
check what is the performance difference if I use bssr = temp.MaxHeap.HeadValue;

BACKLOG
accelerate more based on sum desire * f(prio)?

NOTES
high direction on keep speed and homing helps with nice cohesive flocks
